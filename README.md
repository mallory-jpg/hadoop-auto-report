# Hadoop Auto Report
A MapReduce job to calculate and report the number of accidents per make & year of car, given the car's history.

## A Quick Hadoop Refresher
### Basic Commands
|Command   |Name   |Function |
|---|---|---|
|incident_id   |INT   |
|incident_type   |STRING   |I=inital sale, A=accident, R=repair|
|vin_number   |STRING   |   |
|make   |STRING   |Car brand: only populated by incident type 'I'   |
|model   |STRING   |Car model: only populated by incident type 'I'   |
|year   |STRING   |Car year: only populated by incident type 'I'   |
|incident_date   |DATE   |Date of incident occurence   |
|description   |STRING   |Type of repair ('R'), details of accident ('A'), or from where the car was sold ('I')   |

### How to Use
1. Create input & output directoris (if they don't already exist locally) in `hadoop/bin`:
```
hadoop fs -mkdir /user/input
hadoop fs -mkdir /user/output
```
2. Put .csv data into input directory
```
hadoop fs -put <path to csv>/hadoop_mini_data.csv /user/input
```
3. Make sure your data is there:
 ```
 hadoop fs -ls /user/input
 ```
4. Inspect your data. `hadoop fs -cat /user/input/hadoop_mini_data.csv` should return something like this:

5. Run the MapReduce jobs! `run.sh` file should be in the following format:
```
hadoop jar contrib/streaming/hadoop-streaming-1.2.1.jar \
    - file mapper1.py - mapper mapper1.py \
    - file reducer1.py - reducer reducer1.py \
    - input user/input/hadoop_mini_data.csv - output user/output/all_accidents
    
hadoop jar contrib/streaming/hadoop-streaming-1.2.1.jar \
    -file mapper2.py -mapper mapper2.py \
    -file reducer2.py -reducer reducer2.py \
    -input user/output/all_accidents -output output/make_year_count
```

## üöôüöô The Data üöôüöô
*Stored as a CSV in HDFS*
|Column   |Type   |Info |
|---|---|---|
|incident_id   |INT   |
|incident_type   |STRING   |I=inital sale, A=accident, R=repair|
|vin_number   |STRING   |   |
|make   |STRING   |Car brand: only populated by incident type 'I'   |
|model   |STRING   |Car model: only populated by incident type 'I'   |
|year   |STRING   |Car year: only populated by incident type 'I'   |
|incident_date   |DATE   |Date of incident occurence   |
|description   |STRING   |Type of repair ('R'), details of accident ('A'), or from where the car was sold ('I')   |

## The Job: Map, Then Reduce
1. `mapper1.py` takes in raw data from `stdin` ‚û°Ô∏è returns `vin_number`, (`incident_type`, `make`, `year`)
2. `reducer1.py` takes in `mapper1.py`'s output ‚û°Ô∏è returns all expected details of each unique set of vin_num + make + year that have incident types of 'A' (or accidents)
3. `mapper2.py` creates a composite key of make + year with a value of 1 for each incident count, for example `'Mercedes2015', 1`
4. `reducer2.py` compiles the incident count of each composite key to return the total count of each make & year with registered accidents (`incident_type` 'A')

### Testing
$ `cat hadoop_mini_data.csv | python mapper1.py | sort` yielded:

**Why use sort?**
Without using `sort` on the vin key (to mimic MapReduce's shuffle/sort functionality), `cat hadoop_mini_data.csv | python mapper1.py | python reducer1.py | python mapper2.py | python reducer2.py` returns an error:
