# Hadoop Auto Report
A MapReduce job to calculate and report the number of accidents per make & year of car, given the car's history.

## A Quick Hadoop Refresher

### How to Use
1. 

## üöôüöô The Data üöôüöô
*Stored as a CSV in HDFS*
|Column   |Type   |Info |
|---|---|---|
|incident_id   |INT   |
|incident_type   |STRING   |I=inital sale, A=accident, R=repair|
|vin_number   |STRING   |   |
|make   |STRING   |Car brand: only populated by incident type 'I'   |
|model   |STRING   |Car model: only populated by incident type 'I'   |
|year   |STRING   |Car year: only populated by incident type 'I'   |
|incident_date   |DATE   |Date of incident occurence   |
|description   |STRING   |Type of repair ('R'), details of accident ('A'), or from where the car was sold ('I')   |

## The Job: Map, Then Reduce
1. `mapper1.py` takes in raw data from `stdin` ‚û°Ô∏è returns `vin_number`, (`incident_type`, `make`, `year`)
2. `reducer1.py` takes in `mapper1.py`'s output ‚û°Ô∏è returns all expected details of each unique set of vin_num + make + year that have incident types of 'A' (or accidents)
3. `mapper2.py` creates a composite key of make + year with a value of 1 for each incident count, for example `'Mercedes2015', 1`
4. `reducer2.py` compiles the incident count of each composite key to return the total count of each make & year with registered accidents (`incident_type` 'A')

### Testing
$ `cat hadoop_mini_data.csv | python mapper1.py | sort` yielded:

**Why use sort?**
Without using `sort` on the vin key (to mimic MapReduce's shuffle/sort functionality), `cat hadoop_mini_data.csv | python mapper1.py | python reducer1.py | python mapper2.py | python reducer2.py` returns an error:
